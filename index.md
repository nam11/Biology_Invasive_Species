# Invasive Species

### Introduction
 
Native species are plants and animals that evolved naturally as a part of their local ecosystem. Non-native species are plants or animals that humans have introduced accidendtally or intentially, to a foriegn environment and thrive there. Invasive species are non-native species whose introduction will likely cause harm to the environment. An example of invasive species in the Sonoran desert is buffelgrass.

## 1. Buffelgrass
### 1.1 Buffelgrass: Background

Buffelgrass is native to deserts in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The U.S. Soil Conservation Service brought buffelgrass to the Southwest deserts in the 1970s and 1980s. Buffelgrass was originally brought to the United States with the hope that it would serve as another food source for cows and to manage soil erosion. Scientists chose buffelgrass because of its drought tolerance and high seed production. The buffelgrass escaped from the original enclosures where it was planted and spread across the Sonaran desert. 

Buffelgrass is a light green colored bush. Deep purple flowers are on the ends of long, skinny stalks. The fluffy seeds inside of the flowers are carried by the wind and spread quickly. Buffelgrass ranges from a couple inches to three or four feet tall. Buffelgrass clusters densely around other buffelgrass plants. The leaves of buffelgrass are longer and wider than typical native desert plants. Buffelgrass leaves are also quite dry and flammable. For this reason, the National Park Service has categorized buffelgrass as <i>one of the greatest threats to the Sonoran Desert</i>. [1]

## 2. The Problem

The problem with buffelgrass is its high flammability. Buffelgrass acts as a super-fuel for wildfires. The buffelgrass wildfires cause a decline in the diversity of native plants. This also results in habitat loss for native animals.

The addition of buffelgrass to the Sonoran desert has not caused an increase in the number of wildfires, but buffelgrass worsens the fires that are common to the Sonoran desert. The additional "fuel" has caused fires to burn hotter and spread farther than before buffelgrass was introduced to the Sonaran desert. The bigger and hotter fires burn plants native to the Sonoran desert. The buffelgrass-fueled wildfires are specifically risky for plants that grow slowly, like cacti, or are easy to alight, like bushes.

The plants that live in deserts where buffelgrass is native, have evolved to withstand hotter fires and consequently are affected by buffelgrass wildfires less severely.

### 2.1 Affected Native Species

Buffelgrass primarily affects shrub-like plants like creosote, saltbush, and busage. The loss of native plants results in habitat loss for native birds, desert tortoises, jaguarundis, ocelots, tarahumara frogs, walker's maniocs, zapata bladderpods, and border ayenias. [2]

## 3. Solution?

Buffelgrass grass has become so widespread in the Sonoran desert that for all intents and purposes it is now a part of the ecosystem. Aside from the bigger and hotter fires, the buffelgrass is not harmful to the environment. Solutions to the buffelgrass problem should focus on the increased fire hazard and not the buffelgrass itself. There is no need to remove all of the buffelgrass if there is a genetic alteration that could limit the buffelgrass fires. Additionally, once the re-engineered bufflegrass are re-released into the Sonoran desert, the heat resistant buffelgrass is also more likely to survive than the non heat resistant buffelgrass, so it'll outcompete the more flammable buffelgrass.

### 3.1 Genetic Editing

Plants inherit their traits through Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (DNA). DNA encodes all of the characteristics in an organism into genes. Genes are pairs of nitrogonous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). All of the gene pairs together make up a genome. There is likely a gene in the buffelgrass genome which controls the flammability and heat resistance of buffelgrass plants. If scientists are able to locate and edit the buffelgrass genome so that the plants are less flammable and more resistant to heat, buffelgrass would only be a non-native species and not an invasive species.

E. Coli has multiple heat resistant strains. E. Coli was researched in a study attempting to isolate the genes that determine whether the E. Coli strain was heat resistant or heat sensitive. The researchers were able to identify the LHR genes were key in the heat resistance. Furthermore, early research suggests that fire resistance genes could be located in a variety of plants, if further research is conducted. [3]

### 3.2 CRISPR: Base Editing, Splicing, Joining, Targeting, & Silencing

CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. In short, CRISPR is a gene editing tool. CRISPR is still being developed and fine tunned; however, CRISPR has made significant scientific advancements and progress. It would be possible for scientists to use CRISPR to alter the genome of buffelgrass to make the buffelgrass more fire-resistant. There are multiple ways for CRISPR to edit an organism's DNA.

<b>Base editing</b> is a relatively new CRISPR advancement.[4] In base editing, there are two gene editors: the cytosine base editor and the adenine base editor. The cytosine base editor can change a nucleotide pair from C-G to A-T. The adenine base editor can alter a nucleotide pair of A-T to a C-G nucleotide pair.

Another feature of CRISPR is <b>splicing and joining strands of DNA</b>. This is where CRISPR can break a DNA strand in half or mend two broken strands of DNA back together. Splicing and joining usually occurs in tandem.[5] Scientists can splice a sequence of DNA in half, add additional genes in between, and then repair the broken DNA back together. In the case of altering the buffelgrass DNA to become more fire-resistant, scientists could use splicing and joining to add and/or delete genes that would make the buffelgrass more resistant to fire and temperatures. **Targeting** is a technique used in CRISPR that pinpoints and targets specific the genes and nucleotides. Targeting will aid scientists using CRISPR on buffelgrass in locating the part of the buffelgrass' genome that needs to be edited.

Finally, CRISPR can **silence** genes. Gene silencing is supressing a specific trait from a particular gene.[6] Gene silencing could be used in the buffelgrass situation to silence the genes that cause the buffelgrass to be more flammable or more sensitive.

### 3.3 Testing

That leaves one last challenge for scientists to tackle: how to ensure that the newly engineered buffelgrass does not have negative unexpected consequences. There needs to be a method to test the buffelgrass in a simulated ecosystem to prevent the editing of the buffelgrass genome to not lead to worse or unpredicted consequences. The 1970s have already showed that there is no <i>undo</i> button after buffelgrass is released into the Sonoran desert. There needs to be a way to test the buffelgrass in a simulated ecosystem.

#### 3.3.1 Biosphere 2

Biosphere is a fancy term for the earth. Bio = biology, and sphere = three dimensional circle. Biosphere 2 is similar to as the name implies. Biosphere 2 is an airtight mini-earth in Tucson, Arizona. Biosphere 2 is 7,200,000 cubic meters. There are five ecosystems under glass domes called biomes: the tropical rainforest, the ocean, the fog desert, the savannah grassland, and the mangrove wetland. The managers of Biosphere 2 are open to using their resources to research ecosystems.

There are several reasons why Biosphere 2 would be a good place to test the effects of altered buffelgrass genes:
1. Biosphere 2 is constantly open to new and ground breaking research.
2. Biosphere 2 has a desert ecosystem that could test the changes made in buffelgrass and see if there are any harmful consequences with the altered plants.
3. Biosphere 2 is airtight and once completely sealed off, will not be able to contaminate the outside environment with the changes.
4. Biosphere 2 is in Arizona; it is close to the environment the potential gene edits will influence.

Biosphere 2 would be an ideal location to test how well the changes scientists make to the buffelgrass genome work without further harming the environment.

### Conclusion:

Invasive species are species that are non-native and will likely cause harm to the surrounding ecosystem. Buffelgrass is an example of an invasive species in the Sonoran desert. Buffelgrass has resulted in more widespread and severe wildfires. These wildfires have burned native plants and caused habitat loss for native animals. CRISPR gene editing could bioengineer a heat resistance gene into the buffelgrass genome, so that the buffelgrass would be a non-native species instead of an invasive species. The changes CRISPR makes could be tested in Biosphere 2 to prevent further harm to the Sonoran desert.
