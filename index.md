# Invasive Species
###### By: Natalie Mendoza

### Abstract:
 
The USDA defines invasive species as species that is not native to the area and whose introduction will likely cause harm to the environment. Invasive species can be a variety of types of life, including plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria.

An example of invasive species in Arizona is Buffelgrass. Buffelgrass has become an invasive species in the Sonoran desert. The addition of buffelgrass to the Sonoran desert has caused an increase in wildfires.

When lightning strikes or human-created fires start, the additional "fuel" of the buffelgrass has worsened and spread the fires farther, burning plants native to the Sonoran desert with it. The wildfires are specifically risky for plants that grow slowly, shrubs and bushes, and animals that live in or near plants affected by the buffelgrass wildfires.

A potential solution would be to bioengineer a heat resistance gene into the buffelgrass. The negative impact that the buffelgrass has on the environment and ecosystem results from the fires, not its presence, so if scientists could prevent the wildfires from affecting the buffelgrass as severely and becoming out of control, then the buffelgrass would not be an invasive species, just a non-native species.



## 1. Buffelgrass

Invasive species are non-native species. In the case of Arizona's buffelgrass, it is a plant species that is invasive; however, plants are not the only type of invasive species. First, let's talk about buffelgrass as a species.

### 1.1 Buffelgrass: Background

Buffelgrass is native to African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries. The U.S. Soil Conservation Service brought buffelgrass to the Southwest deserts in the 1970s and 1980s. It was originally brought to the States in hopes it'd serve as another food source for cows and to control and slow erosion.

Buffelgrass is a light green colored bush that clusters densely together. Buffelgrass ranges from a couple inches to three or four feet tall. The leaves of buffelgrass are longer and wider than typical native desert plants. Those leaves turn a reddish purplish color when under too cold temperatures. They have deep purple flowers on long, skinny stalks. Their fluffy seeds are carried by the wind and spread quickly. Buffelgrass leaves are also quite dry and flammable. For this reason, the National Park Service has categorized buffelgrass as <i>one of the greatest threats to the Sonoran Desert</i>.

## 2. The Problem

Scientists initially planted buffelgrass for it's drought tolerance and high seed production. Unfortunately, the buffelgrass escaped from the original enclosures it was planted in, and has spread across the Southwestern desert. Another trait of buffelgrass was it's high flammability. The buffelgrass acted as a super-fuel for wildfires, which caused the loss of habitat and species diversity.

The plants in the deserts buffelgrass is native to, has adapted to hotter fires, so they are not affected as severely. However, it is not possible to genetically engineer all of the native Southwestern plants to have a higher tolerance for heat due to the sheer amount of time it would take to re-engineer a whole ecosystem, so by increasing the buffelgrass's resistance to high temperatures, buffelgrass will not catch fire or spread wildfires as often or quickly.

### 2.1 Affected Native Species

Buffelgrass primarily affects native birds, desert tortoises, jaguarundis, ocelots, tarahumara frogs, walker's manioc, zapata bladderpod, and border ayenia, creosote, saltbush, and bursage. Creosote, saltbush, and bursage are all native shrubs that are negatively impacted by buffelgrass wildfires. Native animals impacted by buffelgrass all suffer habitat loss from the buffelgrass wildfires.

## 3. Solution?

The buffelgrass is not harming the ecosystem with the exception of the spreading of wildfires, so it is unnecessary to exterminate it from the environment if there is an alternative route that eliminates the threat of wildfires without harming the plant.

Plants get their traits through Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (DNA), and there is likely a gene in the buffelgrass genome that controls the flammability of the plant. If scientists were able to locate and edit the buffelgrass genes, such that the plants are less flammable and more resistant to heat, the invasiveness to the buffelgrass would be minimized without having to take drastic measures to say remove all the buffelgrass, (which is unfeasible given how widespread it has grown).

### 3.1 Bioengineering Fire Resistance Genes

E. Coli, which has multiple heat resistant strains, was researched in a study attempting to isolate the genes that determine whether the E. Coli strain was heat resistant or heat sensitive. The researchers were able to identify the LHR genes were key in the heat resistance.

Furthermore, early research suggests that fire resistance genes could be located in a variety of plants, if further research is conducted.

### 3.2 CRISPR

CRISPR is a gene editing tool that can alter the genes of a living organism. CRISPR is still in the process of development and fine tuning; however, CRISPR has made significant scientific advancements and progress. In this section, what CRISPR can and has done will be discussed, and from there, one could come to their own conclusion on whether CRISPR would be able to be used to alter the genome of buffelgrass to make the buffelgrass more fire-resistant.

Genome editing with CRISPR involves many tools. DNA is a double stranded helix, so CRISPR can work in several ways to alter the genetic sequence.

#### 3.2.1 Base Editing

Base editing is a relatively new advancement of CRISPR. Bases are pairs of nucleotides that serve as a "backbone" or a structural support for DNA. There are four types of nucleotides in DNA: adenine, cytosine, thymine, and guanine. Adenine and thymine pair together, as do cytosine and guanine. The sequence of the base pairs and whether there is an A-T or a C-G pair, creates a strand of DNA and determines what genes each section of DNA is made up of. Changing the sequence and the nucleotide will alter the genetic instructions that a cell receives, and carries out.

In base editing, there are two gene editors: the cytosine base editor and the adenine base editor. The cytosine base editor can change a nucleotide pair from C-G to A-T. The adenine base editor can alter a nucleotide pair of A-T to a C-G nucleotide pair.

#### 3.2.2 Splicing, Joining, and Targeting

Another feature of CRISPR is splicing and joining strands of DNA. This is where CRISPR can break a DNA strand in half or mend two broken strands of DNA back together. Splicing and joining usually occurs in tandem. Scientists can splice a sequence of DNA in half, add an additional codon in between that will do something, and repair the broken DNA back together with the new genes in between. In the case of altering the buffelgrass DNA to become more fire-resistant, scientists could use splicing and joining to add and/or delete genes that would make the buffelgrass more resistant to fire and temperatures.

Targeting, on the other hand, is a technique used in CRISPR in which CRISPR specifically targets and pinpoints the genes and nucleotides that need alteration. CRISPR technology has become increasingly advanced in precision in targeting genes to edit in a genome. Targeting will aid scientists using CRISPR on buffelgrass in locating the part of the buffelgrass' genome that needs to be edited.

#### 3.2.3 Gene Silencing

Furthermore, CRISPR can silence genes. To silence genes, is preventing a trait controlled by a particular gene to not be represented in the organism. The gene is dormant/inactive. Targeting specific genes can help with more efficient gene silencing. Gene silencing could be used in the buffelgrass situation to silence genes that cause the buffelgrass to be more flammable or more sensitive to heat.

### 3.3 Testing
That leaves one last challenge for scientists to tackle: how to ensure that the newly engineered buffelgrass does not have negative unexpected consequences. For the editing of the buffelgrass genome to not lead to worse or unpredicted problems without an undo button, there needs to be a way to test the buffelgrass in a simulated ecosystem.

#### 3.3.1 Biosphere 2

Biosphere refers to the earth. Bio = biology, and sphere = three dimensional circle. In essence: the earth. Biosphere 2, on the other hand, is exactly as the name implies. Biosphere 2 was originally used in an experiment where eight researchers were sealed in to see if they could live there on their own without outside help for two weeks. The experiment had design issues and was not completely successful; however, to this day Biosphere 2 is used for research. In the original experiment, a team of scientists worked together to create a mini "biosphere" just outside Tuscon, Arizona. They called it Biosphere 2, and it is over 7,200,000 cubic feet, and around 3,000 species of plants and animals. It is made of glass domes, and sectioned into 5 ecosystems: tropical rainforest, ocean, fog desert, savannah grassland, and mangrove wetlands, plus the experimental LEO.

For instance, the Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO), is a relatively new development that researches how drops of water can travel through and affect different soil types on a massive scale. In fact, when I was twelve and a half, I conducted an experiment on olla irrigation balls and how much moisture different soil types absorb from them in the LEO dome. I worked on this with peers who were 15, 16, 17, and 18 year old highschool students.

A few things can be concluded from the things I pointed out:
1. Biosphere 2 is constantly open to new and ground breaking research.
2. Biosphere 2 has a desert ecosystem that could test the changes made in buffelgrass and study any consequences that appear.
3. Biosphere 2 is airtight and once completely sealed off, will not be able to contaminate the outside environment with the changes.
4. Biosphere 2 is in Arizona; it is close to the environment the potential gene edits will influence.

This would make Biosphere 2 an ideal solution for testing how well the changes scientists end up making to the buffelgrass genome without harming the environment in the process.

### Conclusion:

Invasive species are species that are not native to their current environment and will likely cause harm to the environment. Invasive species can be any life form. An example of invasive species in Arizona is Buffelgrass. Buffelgrass is native to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, but it has become an invasive species in the Sonoran desert. The buffelgrass has resulted in more severe wildfires. These wildfires have burned native plants and caused habitat loss for native animals. CRISPR gene editing to bioengineer a heat resistance gene into the buffelgrass genome. Then, the buffelgrass would not be an invasive species, just a non-native species.
